The Tweeter mod is developed by Funlerz (http://funlerz.com) and hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/Funlerz/MinecraftTweeterMod

With Tweeter, you can tweet from within Minecraft! Because of how Twitter authentication works, you will have to "initialize" tweeter every time you start a new game. Before you can send any tweets, use the "/tweet" command and you will be prompted to grant access to the mod to allow it to post tweets for you. Then come back to Minecraft with the PIN number you are given and enter the command "/tweet PIN NUMBER HERE" to confirm that the mod can tweet for you.

Finally, you will be able to use the /tweet command successfully. Simply use the command "/tweet" followed by whatever you want to be tweeted, but make sure to surround you tweet with quotation marks for it to work properly!

Example:

/tweet "I am tweeting from within Minecraft! #thanksobama"

If the tweet is too long, you will see a message that your tweet was too long and nothing else will happen.
